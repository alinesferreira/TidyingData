INTRODUCTION

This code book is used for:
a) describing each step applied to clean and tidy data
b) describing/ labelling the variables found in the tydyData.txt document

ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK

a) Describing the steps

1. Read in files and merge data
label files: acvity_labels.txt and features.txt
test data: subject_test.txt, X_test.txt and y_test.txt
training data: subject_train.txt, X_train.txt and y_train.txt
merge all test data files horizontally into one test data
merge all train data files horizontally into one training data
merge the test data and the training data vertically into one dataset

2. Extract only the mean and stardard deviation of the measurements
keep the subject Id and activity columns
identify columns names with "mean" or "standardDeviation"

3. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
change the activity column from numbers 1-6 to descriptive activities: WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING.
  
4. Label the dataset with the descriptive names
remove the () in the columns to make the variable names clean
for a description of the variables, please refer to FEATURE VARIABLES below
  
5. Create a second, independent tidy dataset with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
load the dplyr package to: group the dataset by subject Id and activity; summarize the grouped dataset and calculate the average of eacha variable

For the detailed script, please look at run_analysis.R file.

b) Labelling the variables

FEATURE SELECTION

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details.
