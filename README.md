# TidyingData

As asked by the assignment, this document contains 2 parts: one about how run_analysis.R script works and the other with its code book.

A) How the script works
1. Read in the files and merge data
2. Extract only the mean and stardard deviation of the measurements
3. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the dataset
4. Label the dataset with descriptive variable names
5. Create a second, independent tidy dataset with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject

Each detailed step is in run_analysis.R script

b) Code book

sujectId: ranges from 1 to 30 and is the identification code of each subject who takes place on this reseach.
activity: six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING-DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING,LAYING) which subjects had perfomed wearing a smartphone on their waist.
